VERY IMPORTANT: FOR SOME REASON YOU HAVE TO USE THE OLD CUSTOM OST MOD FOR THE SONG TO WORK, IF YOU KNOW THE FIX, PLEASE COMMENT DOWN BELOW, THANK YOU!

Custom Heist Mod of the song Nock Em by Bossfight. Most of y'all probably know it from geometry dash!

The mod (for now) is consisted out of 4 main tracks, them being the stealth, assault, control and buildup segments.
If you have any feedback on the mod, please comment down below since this is my first ever Payday 2 mod!



Instructions
Make sure to first have SuperBLT, and BeardLib installed. Click the links in the dependency list.

Optional video tutorial for installing SuperBLT, BeardLib, and mod_overrides mods: https://youtu.be/rin_sjSJIkg

After downloading the mod, use a program such as 7zip or WinRAR to extract the main folder of the mod.
Drop that folder into the mods folder which is supposed to be in the game's installation folder (don't know where that is? click here)
In order for this mod to work you need Custom OST by Nate downloaded in your mods folder, simply extract the .zip file into the CustomOSTTracks and you're done!
